## üí• Is Your Browser a Tab-pocalypse? You Need Tab Scanner!

Let's be honest. Your browser looks like a crime scene. You've got 87 tabs open, and you swear you need every single one. There's that recipe from three weeks ago, 12 different "How to fix..." articles from Stack Overflow, a YouTube video of a cat playing a tiny piano, and at least 4 half-finished shopping carts. It's chaos. It's madness. It's... a Tuesday.

What if you could wave a magic wand and instantly bring order to that beautiful mess?

### Enter Tab Scanner: Your AI-Powered Butler for Browser Clutter! ü§ñ

**Tab Scanner** is the superhero your browser has been crying out for. It doesn't just list your tabs; it **understands them**. Using the magic of **on-device AI**, it intelligently scans, analyzes, and categorizes all your open tabs, turning your digital hoarding into a neatly organized library.

## ‚ú® What's in the Magic Box?

* **ü§ñ One-Click AI Categorization:** Forget manual sorting. Click a button and watch as our brilliant (and slightly sassy) AI analyzes your tabs' content, titles, and domains. It groups everything into logical categories like "Development," "AI/Chatbots," "Social Media," or even "Definitely-Not-Work-Stuff."
* **ü™Ñ Instant Tab Groups:** Once categorized, the real magic happens. With a single click, you can move an entire category of tabs (like all 15 of your "Machine Learning" articles) into a brand-new, neatly labeled **Tab Group in its own window**. Go from 87 tabs in one window to 5 tidy groups in seconds. Your RAM will thank you.
* **üß† Smart Simplification:** Did the AI get a little too creative with categories like "Python Stuff," "JS Things," and "React Help"? No problem! The **"Simplify" button** asks the AI to merge similar categories into broader ones, like "Development." It's like having a tiny, obsessive-compulsive librarian living in your browser.
* **‚ö° Blazing Fast Caching:** We know you're busy. Tab Scanner cleverly remembers its previous work. The next time you scan, it only analyzes new tabs, giving you results in a flash.
* **üîç Powerful Search & Navigation:** Can't find that one specific tab? Our built-in search filters through titles, URLs, and descriptions instantly. Once you find it, click to switch to it immediately.
* **üßπ Clean Up with Confidence:** See a whole category of tabs you don't need anymore? Nuke them all with the **"Close Category" button**. It's immensely satisfying.

### Why Is It Awesome?

Because you've got better things to do than play "Where's Waldo?" with your browser tabs. Tab Scanner gives you back your **focus**, your **sanity**, and a surprising amount of screen real estate. It‚Äôs the ultimate tool for researchers, developers, students, and chronic tab-openers everywhere.

**Stop letting your tabs run your life. Tame the chaos. Install Tab Scanner and experience the zen of a perfectly organized browser.**

## üí• Getting Started

So, you've installed Tab Scanner. Congratulations! You're just a few clicks away from transforming your browser from a chaotic mess into a beautifully organized workspace. Let's get you started.

### Step 1: See All Your Tabs in One Place

First things first, let's see what we're working with.

* Click the **Tab Scanner icon** in your Chrome toolbar.
* The main window will pop up, showing you a neat list of every single tab you have open, conveniently grouped by window.
* You can scroll through the list, use the **Search bar** at the top to find a specific tab, or hit the **üîÑ Refresh** button.

> This initial view is your command center for all open tabs.
> 

### Step 2: Unleash the AI Magic ‚ú®

This is where the fun begins. Ready to see the AI work its magic?

1.  Click the big blue **"Predefined Categories"** button.
2.  A modal window will appear, and you'll see a message: **ü§ñ AI analyzing your tabs....**
3.  Once the analysis is complete, the loading message will be replaced by a **category tree**. This is the AI's proposal for how to group your tabs.
4.  You'll see categories like "Development," "Social Media," or "Research," each with a list of the tabs that belong to it.

### Step 3: Manage Your New Categories

Now that the AI has done the heavy lifting, you're in control.

* **ü™ü Move a Category to a New Window (The #1 Feature!)** This is the main event! Next to each category name, you'll see a **"Move to New Window"** button. Clicking this will:
    * Take all the tabs from that category.
    * Open them in a brand new Chrome window.
    * Automatically create a Tab Group named after the category. It's the fastest way to isolate a project or topic.
* **‚ùå Close an Entire Category:** Finished with that research rabbit hole? Click the **red X button** next to a category to close all the tabs within it in one go. (It will ask for confirmation first!)
* **‚úèÔ∏è Rename a Category:** Don't like a name the AI came up with? Just **double-click** on the category name, type a new one, and press Enter.
* **‚ñ∂Ô∏è Expand and Collapse:** Click anywhere on the category header (other than the buttons) to expand or collapse the list of tabs inside.

### Step 4: Power Moves for Pro Organizers

Ready for some advanced features? These buttons appear at the top of the category modal.

* **üß† Simplify Categories:** Did the AI get a little too specific? Click the **"Simplify"** button. The AI will re-analyze your categories and merge similar ones into broader groups (e.g., "Web Development").
* **üí• Create All Groups:** Feeling confident in the AI's suggestions? Click **"Create all groups"** to perform the "Move to New Window" action for every single category in the list. It's the ultimate one-click organization tool!

### A Final Tip: The "Clear Cache" Button üóëÔ∏è

Tab Scanner is smart and uses a cache to remember its work, making future scans much faster. However, if you feel the categorization is "stuck" or you want a completely fresh analysis from scratch, just click the **"Clear Cache"** button on the main screen.

That's it! You're now ready to conquer tab chaos. Enjoy your new, organized browsing experience!
